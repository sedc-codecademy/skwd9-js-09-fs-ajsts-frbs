- Create a Game Component
- Create a Game Interface (id, title, releaseDate, rating, price, shortDescription, genre, publisher)
- Use a structural directive to list all Games using the Game component
(The cards should display all Game properties)

- Every Game component should have a button called [Read Description]
- Use the button (and a structural directive) to toggle between showing and hiding the description of the game.

- Use pipes to display the price in EUR, display a readable date, display the game title AND genre in uppercase, the rating as a 0 to 100 percentage, with 2 decimal points

- Use a directive to set the style of each publisher, specifically change the font-color
- Use a directive to give the Game cards another CSS class based on the genre, and then give them different background colors based on these classes

- Create a custom pipe that abbreviates a string and use it on the game titles
examples: 
Mass Effect = ME
Diablo 3 = D3
Grand Theft Auto V = GTAV
Dragon Age: Inquisition = DAI
