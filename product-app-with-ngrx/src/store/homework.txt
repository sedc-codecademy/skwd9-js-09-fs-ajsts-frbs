Implement delete functionality for removing a product.

As a hint in the products-repository.service.ts I've added the method to make the delete api call, 
and in the products.service.ts the method removeProduct is calling the very same method from the repository, the same approach we do so far. Please have a look at it,
and if you have questions about it please feel free to ping us.

1. Create action delete product 
2. Create effect for delete product that will listen to this action.
3. In the effect call the removeProduct method from the products.service (as we did for update the product) :) 
4. In the products.component.ts create method handleRemoveProduct(). and as you guessed will accept id as property, and 
it has to dispatch the action we have created, which is removeProduct =)

**** Use the implementation of updateProduct as an inspiration and a guide :)
